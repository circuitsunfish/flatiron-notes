general orientation

Delivery = instructional team

Instructor
Chris Erlendson

Chris's direct report- Laura Berge
- reach out to Laura if medical stuff or religious stuff makes it difficult to meet attendance requirements

Might not get through every lab/lesson due to pace 
- make sure get through enough to complete the code challenges and projects effectively

Blogs, code challenges, and projects are required work.  prioritize this
- laura's advice is to pick a topic that you can  write a post about in about an hour or so, unless the instructor requests more time be spent

Interdisciplinary capstone projects seem like a cool idea, but in practice it works better post-graduation.
